I am passionate about the web.

I started taking Skillcrush classes after getting recommendations from my cat. Without her constant encouragement I would have never made it to be a professional Web Developer. One day I will make the Internet a safe place for all cats, where no cat will fear being meme-ified and exploited for their cuteness.

Can't wait to work with you!
